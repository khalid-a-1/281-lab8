# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab08 – Sensors and Actuators

#### Overview

The purpose of this lab exercise is to explore ways the Arduino communicates
with the external environment. We will incorporate one sensor – a device which
gathers information from the external environment for the Arduino, and one actuator
– a device in which the Arduino affects physical change to the external
environment. We will add more sensors and actuators in future labs as we expand
the ways to use the Arduino.

This lab is also structured differently. There are two exploratory exercises intended
to allow us to learn the basic operation of a particular sensor or actuator
and to build a very simple working example. There is then a design exercise in
which your lab team designs a solution to a project, in this case using the sensors
and actuators. Your lab report will be different as well. It will focus solely on the
design exercise. You are to describe the design and operation of your solution to
the presented design challenge.
